      Hi there!! I’m originally from Puerto Rico, la Isla del Encanto (and yes, we are part of the U.S.!). My background is in life sciences. I finished my PhD from the University of California, San Francisco and currently I am finishing a postdoc at the University of California, San Diego. I have done independent research in life sciences for more than 10 years and have expertise in developmental and stem cell biology, molecular biology, genetics, and research design. I’m currently transitioning into industry and have started to expand my skill sets. I have completed a micro- and mini- MBA from Rady School of Management, and I’m currently finishing a data science bootcamp through UCSD extension. As I transition into industry, I am mainly interested in using my background and skills to address an important question/problem while being in an environment conduit for learning. Out of work I enjoy cycling, wipeouts (but trying to learn how to surf), traveling, and learning and experiencing different cultures and foods. Thanks for looking!
